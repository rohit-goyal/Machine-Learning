After the body of the loop has executed, we don't move on to the next line yet; we go back to the for heading line, where the iteration variable takes the value of the next element of the iterable. In the second iteration of the loop above, *city* takes the value of the next element in *cities*, which is \"mountain view\".\n",

Here is another reason why paying attention to your indentation is very important in Python!"
